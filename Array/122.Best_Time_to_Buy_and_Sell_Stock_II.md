[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
```

# 解題方向
1. 前半部與121題相同
2. 取出目前最大的profit之後，判斷是否大於0，有的才加入到最後需要加總的list中
3. 當新增進去之後要將原本的profit 設為 0 ，買賣一次之後要重新計算
4. 更新目前最小值為當前的數值，以便與下一個數值做判斷比較

# 解法

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        profit_list = []
        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            tmp = max(profit, price - min_price)
            if tmp > 0:  # II 新增判斷
                profit_list.append(tmp)
                profit = 0
                min_price = price
        print(profit_list)
        return sum(profit_list)
```
