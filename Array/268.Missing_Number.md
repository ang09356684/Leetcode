[Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.
```

# 解題方向
## 方法一 速度較慢
1. 先比較list長度的數字是否在其中，若不在直接回傳
2. target 設為 0 每一輪都+1 若target不在List中直接回傳

## 方法二 速度較快
1. 使用set 建立set1 0~len(nums) +1 再 減掉 set2 set(nums)
2. 將結果轉成list 取出第0個

# 解法

# 方法一 
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n not in nums:
            return n
        
        target = 0
        for i in range(0,len(nums)):
            if target in nums:
                target +=1
            else:
                return target
```

## 方法二
ex nums = [3,0,1]
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = list(set(range(0, len(nums) +1)) - set(nums))
        # {0, 1, 2, 3} - {3, 0, 1}  
        return result[0] # 2
```
