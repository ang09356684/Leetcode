[Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/)


You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: secret = "1", guess = "0"
Output: "0A0B"
```
Example 4:
```
Input: secret = "1", guess = "1"
Output: "1A0B"
``` 

Constraints:
```
1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000
secret.length == guess.length
secret and guess consist of digits only.
```

# 解題方向

1. 建立兩個dict 要記錄出現過的字元 ( 使用defaultdict(int) 才能在一開始時用 +=1 若用一般的dict{} 會報錯)
2. 先用for loop 檢查同樣位置的guess 和 secret是否相等 若是a +1
3. 若不是則將該字元放到對應的dict 紀錄出現次數
4. 第二次的for loop 要把之前記錄過的dict 查一遍，若出現在secret_count的 也出現在guess_count，將b 加上兩者中出現較少的次數，避免超出範圍


# 解法

## 方法一 
用 range 效率較差
```python
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        from collections import defaultdict
        guess_count = defaultdict(int)
        secret_count = defaultdict(int)
        a = b = 0
        
        for i in range(len(guess)): 
            if guess[i] == secret[i] :
                a +=1
            else:
                guess_count[guess[i]] +=1
                secret_count[secret[i]] +=1

        print(guess_count)
        print(secret_count)

        for k in secret_count:
            if k in guess_count:
                b += min(secret_count[k], guess_count[k])
        return f'{a}A{b}B'
```

## 方法二
將第一次紀錄的 for loop 改用 zip 的方式處理,效率高很多

```python
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        from collections import defaultdict
        guess_count = defaultdict(int)
        secret_count = defaultdict(int)
        a = b = 0
    
        for s, g in zip(secret, guess):
            if s == g:
                a += 1
            else:
                guess_count[g] +=1
                secret_count[s] +=1
 
        for k in secret_count:
            if k in guess_count:
                b += min(secret_count[k], guess_count[k])
        return f'{a}A{b}B'
```
