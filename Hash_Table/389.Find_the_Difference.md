[Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)


You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"
```
Example 4:
```
Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
``` 

Constraints:
```
0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lower-case English letters.
```

# 解題方向
## 方法一 
一個個字元做比較
1. 比較字串長度，由較長的當作s 做for loop 取出字元
2. 若字元的count數大於另一個字串表示是多出的字元,回傳該字元
3. 若字元不存在另一個字串中，回傳該字元

## 方法二 (較佳)
只要是倆倆比較要找出多餘數字或字串的都能用xor做判斷 
1. 定義要被更新的result 變數
2. 分別對兩個字串做for loop 將內部字元用ord() 轉型 ascii
3. 將result 對轉型後的字元做xor判斷
4. 將最後的結果再用chr轉為字元

# 解法

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
        if len(s) < len(t): # 若 s 比較短 交換
            s, t = t, s

        for s_letter in s:
            if s.count(s_letter) > t.count(s_letter):
                return s_letter
            
            if s_letter not in t:
                return s_letter

```

## 方法二
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        result = 0
        for letter in s:
            result ^= ord(letter)
        
        for letter in t:
            result ^= ord(letter)

        return chr(result)
```
