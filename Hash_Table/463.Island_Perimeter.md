[Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)

You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 

Example 1:

![image](/images/463.island.png)
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4
``` 

Constraints:
```
row == grid.length
col == grid[i].length
1 <= row, col <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
```

# 解題方向
1. 用雙指針i,j遍歷整個list
2. 若當前元素等於0 加上4邊的周長
3. 並且判斷同一排的前一個位置元素，和上一排的同樣位置的元素是否為1，**同時該指針必須大於1才能判斷**，若是要將現有周長總和-2(因為相鄰的兩個區塊會同時計算同一邊的長度)


# 解法

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1 :
                    result +=4
                    
                    if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1:
                        result -=2
                    if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1:
                        result -=2
        return result
```
