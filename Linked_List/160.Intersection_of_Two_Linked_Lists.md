[Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

![image](/images/160.statement.png)

It is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

 

Example 1:
![image](/images/160.example_1_1.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

Example 2:
![image](/images/160.example_3.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

Example 3:
![image](/images/160.statement.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
0 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA <= m
0 <= skipB <= n
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
intersectVal == listA[skipA + 1] == listB[skipB + 1] if listA and listB intersect.
```

Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory?

Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

# 解題方向
1. 先計算A,B兩個linkedlist的長度
2. 若有其中一方比較長，先移動兩者的差異次數，讓A,B 為相同長度
3. while 判斷若兩者當前的node不相等且還有值時往下移動
4. 若有相等就跳出迴圈回傳其中一個的node


# 解法

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        
        dummy_a = headA
        dummy_b = headB
        
        length_a = 0
        length_b = 0
        
        while dummy_a:
            dummy_a = dummy_a.next
            length_a += 1
        
        while dummy_b:
            dummy_b = dummy_b.next
            length_b += 1
        
        if length_a > length_b:
            for _ in range(length_a - length_b):
                headA = headA.next
        
        if length_a < length_b:
            for _ in range(length_b - length_a):
                headB = headB.next
                
        while headA and headB and headA != headB:
            headA = headA.next
            headB = headB.next
        return headA
```
